## Purpose
Using team data for the season 2016, 
I tested the correlation between _HIT_ and _Run Scored_.


### Result
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
dat<-subset(Teams, yearID==2016, select=c(R, H))
cor(dat$R, dat$H)
```

## Findings

I found a positive relationship between the two variables.

### _Scatterplot_
*I plotted the relationship.

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(dat$H, dat$R)
```
