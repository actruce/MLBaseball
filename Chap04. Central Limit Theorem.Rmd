node 4 and 5 are most central nodes.

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(sand)
library(igraph)
g = graph.formula(1-5, 1-7, 2-9, 2-4, 3-5, 4-5, 4-6, 4-7)
V(g)
E(g)
plot(g)
```

If there are many samples

```{r}
library(Lahman)
a = subset(Batting, yearID > 2011 & yearID < 2016 & AB >=300)
hist(a$H, main='949 players', breaks=seq(from=0, to=300, by=30))
```

If there are not many samples

```{r}
a = subset(Batting, yearID>2011&yearID<2016&AB>=300&teamID=='NYA')
hist(a$H, main='32 players', breaks=seq(from=0, to=300, by=30))
```

student-t is used when the number of samples is less than 30 and populations' variance is unknown.

```{r}
curve(dnorm(x), -4, 4, ylab='density')
curve(dt(x, df=3), add=TRUE, lty=2)
```
